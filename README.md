### About Me 

I have a strong understanding of new technologies like Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) and Crypto-Currency technology, and I have experience in Solidity and Ethereum. I am also proficient in modern technologies such as Redis, Docker, and Kubernetes for container orchestration, and Cloud Network Technologies like VPC, VPN, and Direct Connect for connecting on-premise and cloud environments. My knowledge of these technologies combined with my experience in cloud computing, enterprise mobility, SRE, DevOps, modern technologies and IT infrastructure management allow me to design and implement comprehensive and innovative IT solutions that drive business growth and improve operational efficiency.
